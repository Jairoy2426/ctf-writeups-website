# TryHackMe - Basic Pentesting

## Introduction

This room covers basic penetration testing techniques including web enumeration, brute forcing, and privilege escalation.

## Task 1: Web Enumeration

### Directory Brute Forcing

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.10 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

**Found directories:**
- `/development`
- `/hidden`

### Exploring /development

Found two text files:
- `dev.txt` - Contains development notes
- `j.txt` - Contains potential credentials

## Task 2: SSH Brute Force

Using the credentials found, attempt SSH login:

```bash
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.10.10
```

## Task 3: Privilege Escalation

### Enumeration

```bash
sudo -l
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

### Exploitation

Found vulnerable binary with SUID bit set. Exploit to gain root access.

## Conclusion

This room demonstrates fundamental penetration testing skills that are essential for any security professional.
